# Who am I?
Wolf Hopkins, a full stack software engineer and graduate from Holberton School New Haven.

# What is it?
An asteroids "clone", or a game that is heavily inspired by the classic arcade game.

# Features
- 360 degree movement
- Shoot things with a variety of weapon modes that come in the form of power-ups
- infinitely increasing difficulty

# Inspiration
I loved arcade games as a kid and have always wanted to make my own. For my Holberton portfolio project I decided to make that dream a reality despite not knowing anything about Lua or Love2D.

# Tips and Tricks and Lessons Learned
- Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, can be very fun and frustrating to play with. I think most people would assume that games are easy to make, but to create one from scratch is a fun challenge.
- Time manipulation commands are useful for debugging. You can build them into your game simply by multiplying `dt` by a time factor and assigning them to a key.
- Time Management is even more important
