# Welcome to my portfolio project for Holberton School New Haven.

# Who am I?
Wolf Hopkins, a full stack software engineer and graduate from Holberton School New Haven.

# What is it?
A game heavily inspired by asteroids written in lua and Love2D.

# Tips and Tricks and Lessons Learned
- Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, can be very fun and frustrating to play with. I think most people would assume that games are easy to make, but to create one from scratch is a fun challenge.
- Time manipulation commands are useful for debugging. You can build them into your game simply by multiplying `dt` by a time factor and assigning them to a key.
