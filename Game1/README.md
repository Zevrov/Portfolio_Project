# Welcome to my portfolio project for Holberton School New Haven.

# Who am I?
Wolf Hopkins, a full stack software engineer and graduate from Holberton School New Haven.

# What is it?
An asteroids "clone" that is inspired by this blog series. [BYTEPATH](https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/blog/issues/30). The series is targeted at beginner game developers and covers the basics of lua + Love2D.

# Tips and Tricks and Lessons Learned
- Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, can be very fun and frustrating to play with. I think most people would assume that games are easy to make, but to create one from scratch is a fun challenge.
- Time manipulation commands are useful for debugging. You can build them into your game simply by multiplying `dt` by a time factor and assigning them to a key.
